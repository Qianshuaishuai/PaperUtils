Choctaw word &quot;okeh&quot; means the same as the American word okay\uff0e But many people don't agree\uff0e Language expert Allen Walker Read wrote about the word &quot;OK&quot; in his report published in the 1960s\uff0e He said the word began being used in the 1830s\uff0e \n<br /> Some foreign-born people wrote &quot; all correct&quot; as &quot;o-l-l-k-o-r-r-e-c-t&quot;\uff0c and used the letters &quot; O\uff0eK\uff0e&quot;instead\uff0e \n<br /> Other people say a railroad worker named Obadiah Kelly invented the word long ago\uff0e They said he put the first letters of his name---O and K---on each thing people gave him to send on the train\uff0e \n<br /> Still others say a political organization invented the word\uff0e The organization wanted Martin Van Buren to be president in 1840\uff0e They called their group the O\uff0eK\uff0e club because Martin Van Buren was born in Old Kinderhook\uff0c New York\uff0e \n<br /> Not everyone agrees with each other\uff0c but experts agree that the word is American\uff0e \n<br /> And it has spread to almost every country on the earth\uff0e \n<br /></div><div>(1)&nbsp;What does the word &quot;okeh&quot; mean in the Choctaw\uff1f
